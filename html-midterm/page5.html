                <li>6 HTML Errors
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Missing &lt;/li&gt; ending tag:</strong> The third list item is missing its closing tag. To fix this you add the &lt;/li&gt; tag.</li>
                        <li><strong>Missing &lt;/td&gt; ending tag:</strong> The third cell in table 1 is missing its closing tag. To fix this you add &lt;/td&gt; tag.</li>
                        <li><strong>Missing &lt;/table&gt ending tag:</strong> After the second table row, the &lt;/table&gt is missing, therefore you should add &lt;/table&gt to fix this.</li>
                        <li><strong>Missing &lt;/tr&gt; ending tag:</strong> After the second table row, the &lt;/tr&gt; is missing, therefore you should add &lt;/tr&gt to fix this. </li>
                        <li><strong>Missing &lt;/p&gt; ending tag:</strong> After "This div contains a nested paragraph.", the closing paragraph tag is missing. To fix this you need to add the &lt;/p&gt; tag.</li>
                        <li><strong>Image tag improperly closed:</strong> After the unordered list, the &lt;img&gt; tag is supposed to be closed using "/&gt;" and not just "&gt;".</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

        <h3>Page 2 Errors</h3>
           <ul>
                <li>3 HTML Errors
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>The &lt;b&gt; tag is unordered:</strong> For the "Interior" heading, the &lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt; tag are outside of the &lth2&gt; tag. The b tag needs to be on the inside of h2.</li>
                        <li><strong>Two broken links:</strong> The "bay" and "segmental arch" links are both broken, because it is not a full absolute link. To complete the absolute link you need to add https:// in front of "www."</li>
                        <li><strong>Incomplete closing &lt;b&gt; tag:</strong> The "New Beehive Inn" in the first paragraph is wrapped in the b tag. However, the closing tag is "&lt;&gt;" and should be "&lt;/b&gt;". </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>1 Logic Error
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Visual Inconsistency:</strong> Overall, the page has hard readability, with inconsistent headers, font size, and unordered divider lines. Therefore, following our h1 header, I organized the sub headers to be h2. Additonally, I completed and reordered the divider lines to be consistent across the page.</li>

                    </ol>

        <h3>Page 3 Errors</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 HTML Errors
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Missing Title, Meta, and CSS Stylesheet Link:</strong> To fix this I like to use "! tab" to generate the meta charset, name, content, scale and title. I then added a link href to the cars css file and set rel to "stylesheet"</li>
                    <li><strong>Missing Doctype:</strong> It is important to always declare a doctype as the first line of code in a document. This page was missing the html doctype which prevented the browser from knowing how to interpret the page. So, I added it! </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>1 Logic Error
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Mispositioned Footer:</strong> The footer that says "Generic Car Page. All rights reserved" was displaying on top of the form. It seemed to be written correctly in the html code, so I went to the css document and messed around with the footer style section. I changed the position from absolute to relative and that fixed the problem!</li>

        <ul>
            <li>3 HTML Errors
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Missing Doctype:</strong> This page was missing the html doctype which prevented the browser from knowing how to interpret the page so, I added it. </li>
                    <li><strong>Missing &lt;td&gt; Tags:</strong> Some lines of code were missing their ending &lt;/td&gt; tag or did not enclose their respective &lt;img&gt; tag, so I added them!</li>
                    <li><strong>Missing Alt Attributes Inside &lt;img&gt; Tag :</strong> Inside the &lt;img&gt; tag, the alt attribute was missing, which provides alternate text to an image. For accessibility purposes, it's best we add this. </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>1 Logic Error
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Misplaced Headers:</strong> Each of the headers - Dogs, Cats, and Other? - seemed to be placed on the wrong column of the table where the images didn't align with their headers. Instead of moving the images to be in the same column as the headers, I moved the headers to be in the correct rows by moving the &lt;th&gt; tags inside the &lt;tr&gt; tags. </li>

                </ol>
