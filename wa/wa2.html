    <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Jilissa, I am 21 years old from Longmont Colorado. I am a senior at the University of Colorado Boulder Leeds School of Business, I double major in Marketing and Business Analytics, and minor in Creative Technology and Design. 
    <p>I currently work at IBM as a Customer Expereince and Transformation Consultant in the Healthcare and Lifescience Industry and part of the Global Communications and Project Management team for Gene Therapy.</p>
    <p>For this class I am very excited to learn html, css, and js. I am very passionate about design and have expereince in UX design at IBM, however, it's time I learn the hard skills of web development. I hope to gain a better understanding of how these different platforms, directories, and structures interact with one another and overall learn some code!</p>
